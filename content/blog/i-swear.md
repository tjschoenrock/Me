I swear I miss you<br>
The magical nights<br>
The 3 AM fights<br>
The promises of life<br>
I swear, Oh, I swear<br>
I still miss you
<br><br>
High octane days<br>
My octave maze<br>
You were the guide<br>
Fighting my odds<br>
More like a torch<br>
I swear, Oh, I swear<br>
I still miss you
<br><br>
Then the darker days<br>
The world’s odds<br>
I don’t know why<br>
Why you leave me<br>
I swear, Oh, I swear<br>
I still miss you
<br><br>
Still I wonder
Promises of life<br>
I will be there<br>
Will you still?<br>
I swear I miss you
<br><br>
Please come.
