Dear reason<br>
I was a bully<br>
A sadist<br>
You were a magic<br>
A beauty
<br><br>
Dear reason<br>
I was quiet<br>
Hiding things<br>
Un-notified pings<br>
You were might<br>
Morphed me<br>
Oh, reason
<br><br>
Life was history<br>
Love: uncovered mystery<br>
Hidden wisdoms<br>
Unspoken kingdoms<br>
Entered thy<br>
Morphing my<br>
Oh, reason
<br><br>
Dear reason<br>
I am a supporter<br>
A lover<br>
You changed me<br>
Wow, reason
<br><br>
Dear reason<br>
Neglected things<br>
Now magical<br>
Imagination wings<br>
Euphoria<br>
Beautiful now<br>
You helped me<br>
Oh, reason
<br><br>
Pondering thoughts<br>
Words I wrote<br>
Were you Atlantis?<br>
Oh, love
<br><br>
Please speak.
