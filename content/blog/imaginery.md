I recall<br>
You did the talks<br>
Mystical walks<br>
Withholding me<br>
Imaginary?
<br><br>
You were shy<br>
My heart’s pie<br>
Living me softly<br>
Sans efforts<br>
Imaginary?
<br><br>
I was worn<br>
Heavenly light!<br>
I was blessed<br>
I lived<br>
Imaginary?
<br><br>
That’s history<br>
More like mystery<br>
Unwept thoughts<br>
Remind me<br>
You were there<br>
Imaginery.
