The first time<br>
I saw you<br>
You had my sight<br>
Withheld by might<br>
And then you smile<br>
That first time
<br><br>
I wondered why<br>
If anytime<br>
Will you talk?<br>
Will you walk?<br>
Beside me<br>
For first time
<br><br>
The chain of<br>
Attraction<br>
Losing our<br>
Traction<br>
Were you<br>
Mine?<br>
That first time
<br><br>
You wipe my<br>
Tears<br>
Forgiving my fears<br>
I ain’t feeble<br>
It’s just the past<br>
And you understood<br>
That first time
<br><br>
Walking the dangers<br>
Fearing the strangers<br>
Please don’t shy<br>
I remember thy<br>
I still love you<br>
From first time
<br><br>
Asking you out<br>
That weird shout<br>
You gave me<br>
I rave you<br>
Magic<br>
My first time
<br><br>
More than<br>
Friends<br>
I believe<br>
We were<br>
But you refuse<br>
Breaking my heart<br>
For first time
<br><br>
But still<br>
I accept it<br>
Anyhow<br>
Still better<br>
My first time
</center>
