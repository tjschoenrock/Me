I be the man<br>
You be the girl<br>
I flip the pan<br>
You swing the curl
<br><br>
You carry love<br>
I carry heart<br>
Beautiful dove<br>
Leads our cart
<br><br>
14 years later<br>
Wonderful marriage<br>
You serve the platter<br>
I lead the carriage
<br><br>
Lost in thoughts<br>
Don't worry a lot<br>
I earn the notes<br>
You prepare the cot
<br><br>
I may be weird<br>
But I'll keep you cheered<br>
I may be ugly<br>
But I'll keep you cuddly
<br><br>
You say I flirt<br>
But I only blurt<br>
Rest assured<br>
Future's cured
<br><br>
Majestic places<br>
Different races<br>
World is beautiful<br>
Beautiful is you
<br><br>
Digging deeper<br>
Within my heart<br>
Feelings creeper<br>
Tear me apart
<br><br>
It's not my thing<br>
This love<br>
It's but beautiful<br>
This love
<br><br>
I can't handle<br>
But only surrender<br>
Second plight<br>
Of my life
<br><br>
I am yours<br>
Will you be mine?<br>
I am happy<br>
If you try?
<br><br>
I be the man<br>
You be the girl<br>
I flip the pan<br>
You swing the curl
<br><br>
Give me a chance.
