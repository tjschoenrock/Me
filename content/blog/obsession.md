The world is obsession<br>
Obsession is you<br>
Your obsession<br>
They shall remember
<br><br>
Leave a legacy<br>
They shall remember<br>
Live a life<br>
You will remember
<br><br>
Higher dreams<br>
Stronger wings<br>
Hidden albatross<br>
Determined to succeed
<br><br>
Life is a race<br>
Many a paths<br>
Keep the pace<br>
Choose your paths
<br><br>
Your obsession<br>
You will achieve<br>
Your passion<br>
You will succeed
<br><br>
Down the valley<br>
Up the hill<br>
You choose your way<br>
Up to the hill
<br><br>
MTFBY.
