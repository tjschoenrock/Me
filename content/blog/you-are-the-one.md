You are the one<br>
Oh, the reason for smile<br>
Love in the Californian drive<br>
The soul of my emptiness<br>
You are the one<br>
Yeah, you are the one
<br><br>
You bring me to life<br>
Hope in the darkness<br>
For let the sunshine<br>
Remove the clouds<br>
Uplifting my soul<br>
You are the one<br>
Yeah, you are the one
<br><br>
Counting the stars<br>
Those silly nights<br>
The petty fights<br>
The empty minds<br>
You are the one<br>
Yeah, you are the one
<br><br>
You take me high<br>
I donâ€™t know why<br>
But you are the one<br>
Yeah, you are the one
<br><br>
Please stay.
