It's you<br>
Stuck in the cue<br>
Dreaming about things<br>
Fresh and new
<br><br>
Will you get ahead<br>
Removing things<br>
Relishing memories<br>
Out of your head?
<br><br>
This obsession<br>
Taking your possession<br>
Will they believe<br>
You deserved a mention?
<br><br>
It gets harder<br>
Know not why<br>
Will they remember<br>
The magical time?
<br><br>
It's you<br>
As always<br>
Stuck in the cue<br>
Gloomy days
<br><br>
They return.
